# React Learning Practice

In this folder, I have shared my React learning journey.  
I created separate folders from **Day-01 to Day-03**, where I documented and practiced the concepts I learned:

- **Day-01:** Basics of React (setup, JSX, components, styling, fragments, etc.)
- **Day-02:** Props, rendering arrays, conditionals, and dynamic styling.
- **Day-03:** Events, state, hooks, useState, closures, and callbacks.

Now, I am practicing all the concepts I learned from Day-01 to Day-03 by building small projects and writing example code inside Practice-01 folder.
